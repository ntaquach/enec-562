Submit a knitted PDF of your analysis as well as your .Rmd file. In your PDF, provide written answers to questions and accompanying tables and figures. I don't want to see any code in your PDF. 

Data:
House sparrows were found on the ground after a severe winter storm in 1898, some of which survived and others of which perished. We are going to analyze the explanatory variables that determine whether a sparrow survived or not. 

Variables include: 
bird weight, WT
age, AG
total length, TL
alar extent, AE 
length of beak and head, BH, 
length of humerus, HL, 
length of femur, FL, 
length of tibio-tarsus, TT, 
width of skull, SK, 
length of keel of sternum, KL.




Question 1: 

1. Fit a simple logistic regression model with just bird weight as the x variable and survival as the y variable.
2. Make a boxplot comparing survival across different weights (2.5) 
3. Interpret the coefficients (on both the logit scale and the odds ratio) (5)
4. Report the the Wald confidence interval for Î²1 (calculated by hand and using confint) (2.5)
5. Report and discuss the results from the likelihood ratio test (5)
6. Check the assumptions of the model (5)

Question 2: 
1. Fit the full model using all of the variables. Decide whether to include or exclude predictor variables based on     multicollinearity (2.5)

2. Check the assumptions of linearity. Decide whether or not to include or exclude predictor variables based on linearity. (2.5)

3. Find the best combination of variables for predicting survival using cross validation. Describe what this method is doing (5) 
    - Interpret the coefficients of this model. (5)
    
4. Train (fit) your final model selected via cross validation on 70% of the data and test (predict) it on 30% it hasn't seen yet (5)
    - Using a cutoff of .6, report the confusion matrix for your model. Interpret Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity in words. (5)
    - Plot the ROC of your model (from the 70%, 30% split) and report out the AUC on the plot. (5)
